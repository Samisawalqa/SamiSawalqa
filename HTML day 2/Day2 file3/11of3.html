    <P>
        4 out of 5 stars<br><br>
        From director <b>Vicki Fleming</b> comes the heartwarming tale of a boy named Pete (Trent Dugson) and his dog
        Rover (voiced by Brinson Lumblebrunt). You may think a boy and his dog learning<br> the true value of fiendship
        sounds familar, but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover plays basketball, and he's doggone good at it.<br>
        <br>
        This movie has everything youcould ask for:
    <ul>
        <li>Basketball</li>
        <li>A dog</li>
        <li>Nail-biting suspense</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    While it may not have been necessary to include all 150 minutes of Rover's championship game in real time,
    Basketball Dog will keep your interest for the entirety of its 4-hour runtime, and<br>
    the end will have any dog lover in tears. If you love basketball ot sports pets, this is the movie for you.<br><br>
