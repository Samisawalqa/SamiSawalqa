            <h1>What is a healthy diet?</h1><br>
            Eating a healty diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealisticly thin, or depriving yourself of
            the foods you love. Rather, it's about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and
            boosting your mood.<br>
