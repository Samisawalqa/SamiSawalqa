    <p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but he's a
        little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.<br><br>
        Jack would really like....
    <ul>
        <li>Roller blades</li>
        <li>Magic tricks</li>
        <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
        <li>A motorized lego set</li>
    </ul>
    You can get all this (and more) at an online toy<br>
    store. Two very popular ones are <a href="hhtps://www.toysrus.com">toysrus.com</a> and <a
        href="http://www.etoys.com/">eToys</a>.
